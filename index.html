              <p>
                I am a beginner html coder, self-taught, I have been developing
                for 3 months already, I can already make a not very complex web
                page. I have a very interesting story of the beginning of all
                this, I have long dreamed of becoming a programmer, but there
                was no person who would push and tell about everything, over
                time I met a guy who has been doing this for several years, and
                got disconnected from him and he helped me learn everything that
                is required for a layout designer , with his help I managed to
                learn the base that is required.
